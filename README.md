# love-for-sandwiches
The visualizations and the dataset from the sandwich-hunter plugin.<br>
Visualization of the data gathered through [Lovac na sendiƒçe](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lovac-na-sendvi%C4%8De/cebplboeldmlomimakpfhbhojajdpaki)<br>
##Open the _Love for sandwiches.ipynb_ for some data-vis goodies!
The visualization is still in early dev, check back soon.
## The dataset!
__The dataset is a mongo dump containing 3 DBs: blic, b92, and n1.__ <br>
The DBs each hold two collections: comments and reactions. It's pretty straigthforward, just dive into it.<br>
I'm reserving the right to request uses of the database to include a citation to a future paper. 
Also it'd be cool if you sent me an email about your project to mihailo@protonmail.com.
